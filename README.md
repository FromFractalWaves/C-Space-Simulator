C-Space Simulation Visualizer (CSSV)
A modular application for visualizing the Computational Spacetime Framework.


C-Plants is an interactive simulation that models plant growth using principles from the Computational Spacetime (C-Space) Framework. This application demonstrates how plants can be modeled as navigators through a geometric computational manifold, optimizing their growth patterns based on resources, constraints, and environmental factors.

The simulation visualizes how plants use various tropisms (directional growth responses) to navigate their environment, seeking light, water, and structural support while avoiding obstacles - all framed within the theoretical C-Space paradigm.

## Key Concepts

### Plants as C-Space Navigators

C-Plants represents plants as entities that:

1. **Navigate a Computational Manifold**: Plants move through a geometric space where distances, paths, and complexity are defined by mathematical relations.

2. **Follow Tropism Principles**: Plants exhibit:
   - **Phototropism**: Growth toward light sources
   - **Gravitropism**: Response to gravity (stems grow up, roots down)
   - **Hydrotropism**: Growth toward water
   - **Thigmotropism**: Response to physical touch (wrapping around supports)

3. **Balance Energy-Coherence Dynamics**: Plants maintain structural integrity (coherence) while optimizing for energy acquisition, managing:
   - **Coherence (H)**: Structural organization and stability
   - **Distortion (D)**: Environmental or internal instability
   - **Temporal Complexity (T)**: Rate of growth or procedural evolution
   - **Spatial Complexity (S)**: Structural organization in 3D space



ok so now that dev_window starts cli.rs in the terminal, lets modify cli.rs to feel more like home and allow us to add files to src/bin/ for more commands

like simulator.rs and help.rs etc
