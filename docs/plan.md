ok so here is the entrypoint.

we need to make a button to launch "plants" where the next window is the plants entry point and we can open the plant creator to modify the parameters for the cspace engine, plant engine, and environment. so we need to build these windows so we can then extract the parameters from the example code, then putting us in position to build the engine and test as we go.

can we make it so that the params are set to a table as like "priming the simulation" so i guess it wouldnt run without a valid config that way. but this way we can set up in the gui
